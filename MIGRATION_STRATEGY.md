# Migration Strategy for Refactored Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines a safe migration strategy to minimize disruption to the development team, especially considering Beth's open PRs.

## Current Situation Assessment

### ✅ What's Safe
- **Database Schema**: No changes to table structure or relationships
- **Alembic Migrations**: Configuration still points to correct paths (`app.models`, `app.db`)
- **API Compatibility**: All endpoints maintain backward compatibility
- **Test Coverage**: All existing tests pass with updated paths

### ⚠️ Potential Risks
- **File Movements**: New directory structure may cause merge conflicts
- **Import Path Changes**: Some internal imports have changed
- **Missing Test Coverage**: Service layer needs comprehensive unit tests

## Recommended Migration Approach

### Phase 1: Immediate Actions (Low Risk)
1. **Merge Coordination**
   - Communicate with Beth about pending PRs
   - Identify which files her PRs modify
   - Plan merge strategy before this refactoring is merged

2. **Test Coverage Enhancement**
   - ✅ Added comprehensive service layer tests
   - ✅ Added repository layer tests
   - Run full test suite: `pytest tests/`

### Phase 2: Gradual Rollout (Medium Risk)
1. **Feature Flag Approach**
   - Keep old routers accessible alongside new ones
   - Allow gradual migration of frontend calls
   - Example: Both `/tasks` and `/api/v1/tasks` work initially

2. **Documentation Update**
   - Update API documentation to show new endpoints
   - Provide migration guide for frontend developers
   - Document breaking changes (if any)

### Phase 3: Full Migration (Higher Risk)
1. **Deprecate Old Endpoints**
   - Add deprecation warnings to old endpoints
   - Set timeline for complete removal
   - Monitor usage to ensure migration is complete

## Merge Conflict Resolution Strategy

### For Beth's Open PRs:

1. **Before Merging Refactoring**:
   ```bash
   # Check what files Beth's PRs modify
   git diff main...beth-branch --name-only
   
   # Compare with files moved in refactoring
   git diff main...refactoring-branch --name-only
   ```

2. **If Conflicts Exist**:
   - **Option A**: Merge Beth's PRs first, then apply refactoring
   - **Option B**: Help Beth rebase her PRs on the refactored structure
   - **Option C**: Create migration commits to minimize conflicts

### Sample Conflict Resolution:
```bash
# If Beth modified app/crud.py and we moved logic to services/
# 1. Apply her changes to the new service files
# 2. Update her imports to use new structure
# 3. Test the integrated changes
```

## Database Migration Safety

### Alembic Verification:
```bash
# Verify Alembic can still access models
alembic check

# Test generating a new migration (should be empty)
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "verify_refactoring"

# If no changes detected, we're safe
```

### Models Import Path:
- ✅ `alembic/env.py` still imports `from app import models`
- ✅ Models are still in `app/models.py`
- ✅ Database schema unchanged

## Testing Strategy

### New Test Coverage Added:
- ✅ Service layer unit tests (`tests/services/`)
- ✅ Repository layer tests (`tests/repositories/`)
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling tests
- ✅ Business logic validation tests

### Test Execution:
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run only new service tests
pytest tests/services/

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html
```

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise after deployment:

1. **Immediate Rollback**:
   - Revert to `app/main_legacy.py`
   - Update startup command
   - All old functionality preserved

2. **Gradual Rollback**:
   - Switch API routes back to old routers
   - Keep new infrastructure for future migration
   - No data loss or schema changes

## Communication Plan

### Team Notification:
1. **Before Merge**:
   - Notify all developers of upcoming changes
   - Share this migration strategy
   - Coordinate with Beth on PR timing

2. **After Merge**:
   - Update development setup documentation
   - Provide new project structure guide
   - Schedule team walkthrough of new architecture

3. **During Transition**:
   - Monitor for issues
   - Provide support for developer questions
   - Update CI/CD if needed

## Success Criteria

✅ **All existing tests pass**  
✅ **No database schema changes**  
✅ **Alembic migrations work**  
✅ **API endpoints respond correctly**  
✅ **Service layer has comprehensive tests**  
✅ **Repository layer has unit tests**  
⚠️ **Team coordination completed**  
⚠️ **Open PRs resolved**  

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Coordinate with Beth on open PRs
2. **Short-term**: Implement feature flag approach if needed  
3. **Medium-term**: Full migration to new endpoints
4. **Long-term**: Remove legacy code after migration complete

This strategy prioritizes team productivity while ensuring a safe, testable migration to the improved architecture.
